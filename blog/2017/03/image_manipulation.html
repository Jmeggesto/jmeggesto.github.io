<p><strong>*Disclaimer: I have zero clue what I'm doing here but it was fun as heck)</strong></p>
<p>I was browsing Facebook when I came across this image:</p>
<p><img src = '/images/color.png' alt = "A picture of a cake topped with strawberries. The red in the image has been severely washed out." width = "60%" height = "60%"></img></p>
<p>As the <a href="">article about this image claims</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, I was curious about whether or not the claim of "not containing any red pixels" was actually accurate. Two  questions sprang to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the actual RGB values of the component pixels? </li>
<li>Would the component pixels of the image appear red to a person if they were contextually dissociated from strawberries, which our brains associate with the color red?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions formed the basis of my curiosity on this topic, Naturally, I decided to use code to see what I could discover, and what answers might exist for this questions.</p>
<h1>Discovering Scikit-Image</h1>
<p>For this task, I installed <a href="">scikit-image</a>, an image manipulation library written in Python. I'm not sure if that was <em>necessarily</em> the best choice - I think scikit and derivatives are much more oriented towards scientific tasks than artistic ones - but it was what showed up when searching on StackOverflow, and it provides the bare minimum for what I need to accomplish this task. I'll touch briefly on what I learned about the library itself.</p>
<p>If I understand it correctly, color images in scikit-image are represented as three-dimensional arrays: the outer layer of arrays allows for access of pixels in a (row, column) fashion, and the inner elements are the representations of the pixels themselves, arrays of length 3 with red/green/blue values. It's an easy enough format to work with and understand, so I started playing around.</p>
<h1>Data About The Image Itself</h1>
<p>Initially, my first instinct was to just print every pixel in the array. That was a wholly silly idea, of course, because the image, at 857px x 857px, contains 734,449 pixels. Nevertheless, it did reveal the answer to my first question immediately.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the terminal output:</p>
<p><img src= '/images/clpixeloutput.png' alt = 'A picture of my terminal output as I printed every pixel in the image.' width = "30%" height = "30%"></img></p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the values in each array represent red/green/blue values, respectively. Here, we can see that yes, some pixels do indeed have red values, and that the red values for each pixel even vary from pixel to pixel. This gets us closer to our first question of: <em>what are the component pixels' RGB values</em>, but in reality it's not very useful. So I decided to go deeper.</p>
