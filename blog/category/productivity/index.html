            <div class="e-content"><p>It's Monday, March 20th. It's been eight days since I posted my first <a href="/blog/2017/03/weeklyplan1">weekly planning post</a>, and guess what - I totally forgot to do my weekly reflection yesterday! So I guess I'm going to do it now, because I'm not going to let it go undone even I forgot to do it on time. </p>
<h1>Monday, March 13</h1>
<p>On Monday, I did implement the heap data structure mostly from memory. That's a fun one, and I'm glad I brushed up on it. I completed about 5 hackerrank problems, going a little overboard from what I had planned. I also started putting the pieces together for my HTTP server. </p>
<p> I did not get around to working in Dijkstra's Algorithm, but I did finally get an okay-looking homepage for my blog. Go check it out; it has my face on it, and I'm pretty. </p>
<p>Also, RIP TweetBoy. My sweet garbage robot son.</p>
<h1>Tuesday, March 14</h1>
<p>Tuesday was a snowday and I got in late, but I managed to interface with Andrew Kelley and we did a bunch of work to get Zig's <code>pow</code> function into a pretty okay state, along with some other necessary additions to the stdlib. That's most of what happened that day, with maybe some additional learnings/investigation that aren't worthy of talking about.</p>
<h1>Wednesday, March 15</h1>
<p>I for the life of me cannot remember what happened today. Oops, all memory loss! If I do remember I'll amend this blog post to discuss it.</p>
<h1>Thursday, March 16</h1>
<p>I finished up my Haskell HTTP server just in time to do a live demo at RC, which went fantastically. I didn't do too much other work, however - there was a board games night wherein I ate much good pizza and drank many good libations. Fun stuff.</p>
<h1>Friday, March 17</h1>
<p>I had a job interview! I interviewed with a fantastic company called Rent The Runway, and was engaged with them for most of the day. I managed to then give another demo of my HTTP server <strong>at</strong> the company I had just interviewed with - which will become its own blog post, mark my words.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I got a lot of things done. I learned a bunch about Haskell, especially concurrency and more about sockets and HTTP. I implemented a <code>pow</code> function, which is not trivial (and might become its own blog post), wrote blog posts and polished my website. And I also discovered that I sometimes can't remember a lot of what happened the previous week, so I probably need to start recording daily what I do.</p>
