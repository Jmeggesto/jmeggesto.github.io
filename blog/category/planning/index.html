It's been eight days since I posted my first <a href="/blog/2017/03/weeklyplan1">weekly planning post</a>, and guess what - I totally forgot to do my weekly reflection yesterday! So I guess I'm going to do it now, because I'm not going to let it go undone even I forgot to do it on time. </p>
<h1>Monday, March 13</h1>
<p>On Monday, I did implement the heap data structure mostly from memory. That's a fun one, and I'm glad I brushed up on it. I completed about 5 hackerrank problems, going a little overboard from what I had planned. I also started putting the pieces together for my HTTP server. </p>
<p> I did not get around to working in Dijkstra's Algorithm, but I did finally get an okay-looking homepage for my blog. Go check it out; it has my face on it, and I'm pretty. </p>
<p>Also, RIP TweetBoy. My sweet garbage robot son.</p>
<h1>Tuesday, March 14</h1>
<p>Tuesday was a snowday and I got in late, but I managed to interface with Andrew Kelley and we did a bunch of work to get Zig's <code>pow</code> function into a pretty okay state, along with some other necessary additions to the stdlib. That's most of what happened that day, with maybe some additional learnings/investigation that aren't worthy of talking about.</p>
<h1>Wednesday, March 15</h1>
<p>I for the life of me cannot remember what happened today. Oops, all memory loss! If I do remember I'll amend this blog post to discuss it.</p>
<h1>Thursday, March 16</h1>
<p>I finished up my Haskell HTTP server just in time to do a live demo at RC, which went fantastically. I didn't do too much other work, however - there was a board games night wherein I ate much good pizza and drank many good libations. Fun stuff.</p>
<h1>Friday, March 17</h1>
<p>I had a job interview! I interviewed with a fantastic company called Rent The Runway, and was engaged with them for most of the day. I managed to then give another demo of my HTTP server <strong>at</strong> the company I had just interviewed with - which will become its own blog post, mark my words.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I got a lot of things done. I learned a bunch about Haskell, especially concurrency and more about sockets and HTTP. I implemented a <code>pow</code> function, which is not trivial (and might become its own blog post), wrote blog posts and polished my website. And I also discovered that I sometimes can't remember a lot of what happened the previous week, so I probably need to start recording daily what I do.</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p>It's Monday, March 13th, 2017, and a new week lies ahead of me, tender and raw, like a slab of meat waiting for a butcher to carve off its choicest cuts. Usually I shamble through each week, happening upon those delightful  morsels with no real rhyme or reason. Most of the time, that approach allows me to discover knowledge and arrive at new understandings in a very holistic and organic way, taking me down paths I wouldn't have expected. Sometimes it leads to the opposite - stagnation and inaction because of a lack of clear goals, or a lack of motivation.  Starting this week, I've decided to try something different - writing a blog post each Monday that outlines in some detail the things I want to accomplish or attempt in the next seven days. It won't necessarily be an exhaustive outline that has me following a rigid itinerary, but it'll hopefully provide some much-needed scaffolding for my weekly activities. Each Sunday, I'll write a "Weekly Reflection" that discusses what I learned and did each day of the previous week, how I'm feeling in general, etc. I'm excited to see how this scheme plays out and if it's better than how I'd been working before. So without further ado, let's make a plan.</p>
