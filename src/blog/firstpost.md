# New-Bloggen in Internaetum
# (Listen! Me, of the New Blog On the Internet):

So I've made multiple attempts at blogging in the past, but I've felt dissatisfied with most of the blogging sites/engines I've used, either feeling like a service was holding my hand ad nauseum, or feeling compelled to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and just create static sites myself from scratch. Neither option was all that wonderful, until the wonderful [Alex Jordan](https://strugee.net) introduced me to his static site generator, Stratic. It's what's building the webpage you're reading right now. It's pretty cool and for me, is the perfect intermediate between doing everything for you, and doing nothing. So I'm pretty pleased to say that, with any likelihood, I'll be getting into blogging again.

# (What Tribute Shall Be Yielded?)

Expect a lot of programmer/software stuff. Expect a lot of me talking about personal projects or showing off personal projects. Expect me to blog about things like social justice, gender, feminism, disability, politics, etc. Expect me to talk about food a lot. I might use weird neologisms and odd grammar and syntax, because language in day and age of now is for to be made weirder. 

# That Waes God Bloggen!

I hope to get a good little blag going here and talk about a buncha cool stuff. Let's hope I can retain the steam to turn it into something wonderful.
