It's Monday, March 20th. It's been eight days since I posted my first [weekly planning post](/blog/2017/03/weeklyplan1), and guess what - I totally forgot to do my weekly reflection yesterday! So I guess I'm going to do it now, because I'm not going to let it go undone even I forgot to do it on time. 

# Monday, March 13

On Monday, I did implement the heap data structure mostly from memory. That's a fun one, and I'm glad I brushed up on it. I completed about 5 hackerrank problems, going a little overboard from what I had planned. I also started putting the pieces together for my HTTP server. 

 I did not get around to working in Dijkstra's Algorithm, but I did finally get an okay-looking homepage for my blog. Go check it out; it has my face on it, and I'm pretty. 
 


Also, RIP TweetBoy. My sweet garbage robot son.

# Tuesday, March 14

Tuesday was a snowday and I got in late, but I managed to interface with Andrew Kelley and we did a bunch of work to get Zig's `pow` function into a pretty okay state, along with some other necessary additions to the stdlib. That's most of what happened that day, with maybe some additional learnings/investigation that aren't worthy of talking about.

# Wednesday, March 15

I for the life of me cannot remember what happened today. Oops, all memory loss! If I do remember I'll amend this blog post to discuss it.

# Thursday, March 16

I finished up my Haskell HTTP server just in time to do a live demo at RC, which went fantastically. I didn't do too much other work, however - there was a board games night wherein I ate much good pizza and drank many good libations. Fun stuff.

# Friday, March 17

I had a job interview! I interviewed with a fantastic company called Rent The Runway, and was engaged with them for most of the day. I managed to then give another demo of my HTTP server **at** the company I had just interviewed with - which will become its own blog post, mark my words.

# Conclusion 

I got a lot of things done. I learned a bunch about Haskell, especially concurrency and more about sockets and HTTP. I implemented a `pow` function, which is not trivial (and might become its own blog post), wrote blog posts and polished my website. And I also discovered that I sometimes can't remember a lot of what happened the previous week, so I probably need to start recording daily what I do.
