"Aesthetic Realism NYC"

reads the sing hanging above

a doorway in Soho; 

the subscript proclaims this to

be a "terrain gallery".

I've only lived in New York City for 

three, maybe four years

at most -

but I can say without 

a doubt, that the 

aesthetic of this, the

center of my world,

my home and my life,

this wondrous city shining

at the mouth to the Atlantic,

are very lovely;

I just with the pain 

of being alone

in a city of eight million

wasn't so steeped

in realism.
