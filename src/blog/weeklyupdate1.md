It's Monday, March 20th. It's been eight days since I posted my first [weekly planning post](/blog/2017/03/weeklyplan1), and guess what - I totally forgot to do my weekly reflection yesterday! So I guess I'm going to do it now, because I'm not going to let it go undone even I forgot to do it on time.
