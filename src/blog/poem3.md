If waiting for familiarity

were a phenomenon as refreshing

as the smell, the taste,

the experience of cool water

running down your throat in

a smoky room where your body

can move as it pleases, carried

away by a pure sound and a pure

moment and the pure fire of life

inside of you, how long

would you have waited on

that curb?

Would you have been stuck there

forever, waiting for a perfect

comfortable moment that you 

knew would never arrive?

Venture into the darkness, child;

brave the terror of the red lights,

the lightning-fast noise, the smoke;

the only thing you have to fear is 

the fact that you were willing 

to wait idly as destiny

passed you by.
